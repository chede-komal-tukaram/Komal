#FILE OPERATIONS

##file reading operations

# go to the file path or folder and locate file with file name
#open File
#read content/write content to file
#copy content you got from file and use it.
#file close

#filevariable:-
# open(r"D:\Komal>\sample.txt")       #r is for row string
# filevariable  = open("sample.txt")
# #if you dont provide full path then it use relative path
# #search in same folder where you have a program.
# content = filevariable.read()
# print("File content : ",content)
# filevariable.close()
